        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 sticks unsalted butter, softened, plus 1 tablespoon, for greasing</li>
                <li>1 ⅓ cups all purpose flour</li>
                <li>⅓ cup dried nonfat milk powder</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon saffron thread</li>
                <li>8 cardamom pods, slightly crushed</li>
                <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp kewra essence/extract (not water)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons fresh lime juice</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the cardamom cake: Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). Grease a 10-cup Bundt pan liberally with 1 tablespoon of butter. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour and milk powder together until well combined.</li>
                <li>Add the butter, sugar, and ground cardamom to a separate large bowl and mix with a hand mixer for 5-7 minutes; the butter will turn pale and fluffy. Add the salt and vanilla and stir to combine. Add 1 egg at a time, beating well between each addition. Add the flour mixture. Mix until the dry ingredients are just incorporated.</li>
                <li>Spoon the batter into the Bundt pan and tap the pan on the counter 3–5 times to remove air bubbles.</li>
                <li>Bake the cake for 35–40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.</li>
                <li>10 minutes before the cake is done baking, make the syrup: Add the water, granulated sugar, saffron, cardamom pods, and cinnamon stick to a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the kewra and lime juice. Remove the cinnamon stick and cardamom pods from the syrup and discard. Reserve ¼ cup (60 ml) of the syrup and set aside.</li>
                <li>Poke holes in the bottom of the Bundt cake with a fork. Pour the rest of the syrup over the Bundt cake while it is still warm in the pan. It will look like a lot of syrup, but the cake will soak it all up. Let the cake rest for 10 minutes, then invert it onto a serving platter.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and reserved syrup to make a glaze.</li>
                <li>Pour the glaze over the Bundt cake. Sprinkle with the dried rose petals, if using, and pistachios.</li>
            </ol>
